# CrowdFilter

CrowdFilter is a project of the [Chair of Privacy and Data Security](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/ps), Faculty of Computer Science at the TU Dresden, developed by [@bitkeks](https://twitter.com/bitkeks).

The project aims to create a technical solution for hiding unwanted content on websites. For this, clients use a browser addon to mark and classify text on websites. These classifications could for example be racism, harassment or other unwanted content. As soon as we have enough data collected, we will evaluate the possibility of creating automatic filters based on this data. This means, the more classifications you send to us, the more precise we can build those filters!
