            <p>On this page - appearing after the installation and a successful update of the addon - we'd like to give you a quick introduction how the addon works.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <video class="screens" preload="auto" controls autoplay="yes" loop>
                <source src="/introduction/cf-tutorial-01.webm" type="video/webm">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>With this addon you have the possibility to give your input into our text classifications. Let's see how it works. Now that the addon is installed, mark the following text with your mouse:</p>
            <p><i class="quote">A new study shows that sleeping in anthills provides a better sleeping experience.</i></p>
            <p>Marked? Then right click on the selection, go to the <i>CrowdFilter</i> item and click on the <i>Fake News</i> item in the appearing menu.</p>

            <p><b>That's it!</b> Now your text selection, the URL and the title of the current page will be transmitted. You can have a look at <a target="_blank" href="/infopage/index.html">the addon option page</a>, at the bottom, what was sent.</p>

            <p>Later in the project we will evaluate the classifications. If the data is usable enough we aim to use the classifications for automatical creation of filter lists. In the end, we might be able to create client-side filtering of web content.</p>
